# Hospital Management System üè•

A comprehensive **desktop application** that simulates a real hospital environment. This project is a practical implementation of programming skills including **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **system design**, **database integration**, and **interface design**.

The system provides complete management of daily hospital operations, including **patients, doctors, staff, appointments, medical records, lab tests, prescriptions, billing**, and **user management** with roles and permissions.

---

## üöÄ Project Purpose

The Hospital Management System is designed to:

- Provide a **realistic simulation** of hospital workflows.
- Manage all aspects of hospital operations in a **single desktop application**.
- Apply and demonstrate **programming and design skills** including:
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Layered Architecture
  - Database integration with SQL Server
  - User interface design with Windows Forms (WinForms) and Guna UI

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **C#** ‚Äì Main programming language.
- **.NET Framework** ‚Äì Framework for building the desktop application.
- **Windows Forms (WinForms)** ‚Äì For creating modern GUIs.
- **Layered Architecture** ‚Äì Organizing code into Models, Data Access Layer (DAL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), Services, and Forms.
- **SQL Server Management Studio 19 (SSMS 19)** ‚Äì Database management and queries.
- **ADO.NET** ‚Äì For connecting the application to the database.
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2022** ‚Äì IDE used for development.
- **Guna UI Framework (Optional)** ‚Äì For enhanced modern UI elements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features / Functionalities

### Dashboard
- Quick insights with interactive **cards** for:
  - Daily statistics: appointments, patients, lab tests, invoices
  - Graphs for patient distribution, lab tests per department, yearly trends
- Latest registered patients for quick access
- News & updates section
- Help & guidance section
- Side navigation menu for easy access

*Note: Some data displayed is sample/test data.*

### User & Role Management
- Create and manage system users
- Assign **roles and permissions** for fine-grained access control

### Patient Management
- Register and update patient information
- Track appointments linked to **medical records**

### Doctor & Staff Management
- Manage doctors and staff information
- Assign tasks and responsibilities

### Appointments, Medical Records, Lab Tests & Prescriptions
- Manage **appointments, medical records, lab tests, and prescriptions**
- Activate/deactivate lab test types (restricted to authorized users)
- Workflow:
  1. Schedule patient appointment
  2. Record actual visit
  3. Create or link medical record
  4. Doctor diagnoses, orders lab tests, and prescribes
  5. Schedule follow-up if needed

### Billing & Payments
- Manage hospital invoices (paid/unpaid)
- Detailed payment history and methods
- Issue invoices linked to appointments for authorized users

### Audit / Activity Logs
- Track all system operations
- Detailed logs for transparency and accountability

### User-Friendly Interface
- Modern UI with Windows Forms and Guna UI
- Consistent navigation across all modules

## üèó System Architecture

The system uses a **Layered Architecture** to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

### 1. Data Access Layer (DAL)
- Service classes responsible for database connectivity
- Static repositories for each entity (Patients, Doctors, Appointments, etc.)
- Uses **ADO.NET** for database communication
- Can be upgraded to **Entity Framework** in the future

### 2. Models Layer
- Defines classes representing system entities (Patient, Doctor, User, Appointment)
- Stores properties and structure of objects

### 3. Interfaces Layer
- Defines **contracts** (interfaces) implemented by service classes
- Promotes loose coupling between layers

### 4. Services Layer
- Implements interface contracts
- Bridges **DAL** and **Presentation Layer**
- Contains **business logic and validation rules**

### 5. Presentation Layer (Forms)
- GUI built with **WinForms** and **Guna UI**
- Forms include Dashboard, Patient Management, Billing, etc.

### 6. Utilities Layer
- Reusable helper classes and utilities
  - Input validation
  - Security (e.g., password hashing)
  - Common operations
- Global settings accessible across the system

## üóÑ Database Design / Schema

The database design follows **relational best practices** to ensure flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.

### Highlights:
- **Core Person Entity** ‚Äì Central table for all roles (Patient, Doctor, Staff, User)
- **Departments** ‚Äì Medical and administrative departments
- **Users, Roles, Permissions** ‚Äì Fine-grained hierarchical permissions
- **Appointments & Medical Records** ‚Äì Link patients, doctors, and visits
- **Billing & Payments** ‚Äì Detailed bill items and payment history
- **Lab Tests & Prescriptions** ‚Äì Track requested tests and prescribed medications
- **Audit Logs** ‚Äì Automatic tracking of all system operations via triggers
- **Performance Enhancements** ‚Äì Views and Stored Procedures for faster queries
